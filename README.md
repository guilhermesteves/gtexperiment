Google Translate Experiment
============

Simple experiment using Google Translate via a Javascript page.

Using the library HtmlUnit, the goal of this project is to use Google Translator API for free.


Warning
============

This is just an experiment to show it's possible to use it like this.
Please, pay to use Google's API. They invested a lot of money and time in Google Translator.
Thank you,

Guilherme Esteves
